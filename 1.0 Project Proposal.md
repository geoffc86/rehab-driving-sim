# 1.0 Rehab Driving Simulator Project Proposal

#### Description
The goal of this project is to develop a driving simulator, capable of providing haptic feedback, that can help rehabilitate drivers who have been physically challenged. We will be using a driving simulator provided by Prof. Smith’s mechanical engineering team, possessing all the necessary controls and equipment. That includes a seat, throttle and brake controls, steering controls, and the pneumatic system. We will be modifying open-source code that precisely controls the simulator’s pneumatic bladders. Out-of-the-box, the simulator provides realistic feedback, simulating the g-forces experienced while driving on the road. We will modify the system to provide a quasi-haptic experience that will potentially be much less stressful for the recovering driver. The manufacturer of the simulator will help us with any questions we have about the hardware.

We want to develop the most accurate software possible so that our end product is a usable research tool. This life-like feedback is what differentiates our project from similar rehabilitative simulators. Other research does exist in this domain, but none of their machines provide physical feedback. That means the their data excludes the haptic and vestibular variables of driving. Our simulator will likely be the first of its kind, providing a genuine driving experience for those recovering from physical ailments.

#### Justification
This project will give our team the opportunity to leverage a wide variety of skills honed in previous LMU computer science courses. On a broad level, this includes writing professional-quality object-oriented code at a high level, using such industry best-practices as unit-testing/test-driven development and version control, responding to and providing feedback, and keeping to a production schedule. On a finer scale, this includes such specific details as - for example - implementing three-dimensional camera angles and writing low-level system code for the hardware itself. The existing simulator software has a large open-source modification community, speaking both to the social aspects of programming and the more creative side of writing software.

Prof. Smith feels that, due to the potential scope of modifications to the off-the-shelf software and iterations thereof, this project would be most appropriate as a two semester-long project, and our team agrees. While this project might seem on the surface to be a relatively simple matter of adapting existing software to a different set of needs, we do not believe this will prove to be an especially easy task. The existing codebase is on the scale of a commercial video game. Additionally, due to the complex combination of the hardware, controller firmware, and the existing simulator software, it will likely be an extremely educational challenge to fully master the ways in which they interact. To this end, we currently possess the proper combination of hardware and off-the-shelf simulator software the project requires, and we believe writing the relevant custom portions to be within the skill set of our team. Our team finds this project extremely exciting, as do Prof. Smith’s mechanical engineering students.
