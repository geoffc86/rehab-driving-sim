## 4.1 Plan Introduction

This document serves as a Software Development Plan (SDP) for the LMU Rehabilitation Driving Simulator, the purpose of which is to assist the recovery and rehabilitation efforts of people who have suffered a stroke or other serious brain injury. Thus, the primary users will be people who have suffered a brain injury, and are learning how to drive again. The goal of the driving simulator project is to help these drivers regain confidence on the road by allowing them to practice driving on realistic simulated tracks that we have specifically created, altered, or otherwise tailored to this purpose. The simulator offers a car seat, which moves to provide haptic feedback expressing the reality of driving, and typical driving controls. In order to provide a life-like experience in a safe environment, software with a high degree of precision is required to link this interface and the simulated roadway; this sandbox approach will help the user overcome the anxiety and stress of effectively being a new driver on the road.

The development of this project began on August 29, 2018. The team has completed several deliverable documents and each member has received training certifications for research involving human subjects. As the team is expected to make the driving experience as real as possible while also respecting the conditions of our users, not only is our task to create and program different driving tracks, but also to communicate with the mechanical engineering team to ensure that the hardware's feedback works in concert with the user controls and matches what users would expect. The whole team is very passionate about the project, and it is our goal to make the Rehabilitation Driving Simulator a successful model of real-world driving and as beneficial to its users as it can be.

### 4.1.1 Project Deliverables - Documentation

#### 4.1.1.1 - Project Proposal/Presentation
The project proposal consists of a description of and a justification for the project. The description provides a high-level overview of the project, and the justification explains the team's choice of project.

Due Week 2 (5 September)

#### 4.1.1.2 - Software Requirements Specification Document
The Requirements Specification serves as the contract between customer and development team, and as a road map of the specifications for the project. It formalizes the functionality that must be implemented through the project.

Due Week 5 (26 September)

#### 4.1.1.3 - Software Development Plan (complete)
The Software Development Plan (this document) is a detailed outline of all the documentation for and work that will  e performed on the project over the course of the year.

Due Week 7 (10 October)

#### 4.1.1.4 - Software Design Description Document (Architecture Section)
The Software Design Description (Architecture) presents details of the overall architecture of the software system, specifying the system components and their interrelationships.

Due Week 11 (7 November)

#### 4.1.1.5 - Detailed Software Design Specification Document (Complete)
The Detailed Software Design Document provides all of the implementation details about all of the different parts of the project.

Due Week 12 (14 November)

#### 4.1.1.6 - Unit Test and Integration Plan
The Unit Test and Integration Plan outlines the process which will be used to build the final product. This document provides a detailed description of the software testing strategies used on the project.

Due Week 14 (28 November)

#### 4.1.1.7 - User's Manual Final Updates
The User’s Manual conveys to end users how the software is to be used. The Final Updates serve to describe the actual state of the system after development has been completed.

Due Week 15 (5 December)

#### 4.1.1.8 - Final Presentations/Demonstrations
The purpose of the Final Presentation is to share the results of the project with the rest of the class and the department. Demonstrations are to offer hands-on, real-time interaction with the software (though this will clearly be somewhat difficult for our project, with its specialized hardware requirements).

Due Week 16 (12 December)

### 4.1.2 Project Deliverables - Work Product

#### 4.1.2.1 - Experiment Scheduler
This portion of the system is a graphical user interface that will manage user data and all of the other subsystems. It will be the final piece of the system to be developed during the winter and spring.

#### 4.1.2.2 - Training Scenarios
Training scenarios will give users a chance to practice their driving skills in a sandbox environment. This will be the second piece of software to be developed starting in the month of December, and on an ongoing basis through the winter and spring.

#### 4.1.2.3 - Test Scenarios
Similar to the training scenarios, test scenarios will give users a chance to evaluate the skills they have developed during training. This will be developed in parallel with the training scenarios, starting in the month of December, and on an ongoing basis through the winter and spring

#### 4.1.2.4 - Data Acquisition
The telemetry module is the portion of the software that records actionable data from the user’s interaction with the system for the purpose of feedback. This is the first piece of the software to be developed during the months of October and November.


## 4.2 Project Resources
The software for this project will be developed by the team members working collaboratively to:
* build a client application
* build a practice framework for users to train and rehabilitate their driving skills
* build an evaluation framework for researchers and healthcare professionals to test users' progress 
* create tracks and courses for both of the aforementioned services
The team will also be completing all documentation, presentations, and anything else needed for the project.

## 4.3 Project Organization

### 4.3.1 Documentation and Deliverables:
The deliverables to-date are the Project Proposal and Presentation, Requirements Specification, Preliminary Development Schedule, and Software Development Plan. Geoff Colman and Jackson Myers completed the project proposal presentation and documentation. After, they both communicated with Simon Wroblewski and Marissa Alvarez to complete the rest of the documentation as a team. In the future, the team will be completing the rest of the documentation together.

### 4.3.2 Experiment Scheduler:
This UI-based component of the project will act as a launcher, initializing scripts to run our core software and its various components and extensions. By managing user profiles, it will also act as a means of tracking and saving data about individual participants.

### 4.3.3 Training Scenarios:
For this task, we will be inviting volunteers who have signed the informed consent form to participate in research on simulated driving with quasi-haptic feedback. All of the team members will gather a few volunteers to gain more data for our project’s research goals.

### 4.3.4 Test Scenarios:
This part of the software involves evaluating participants on their abilities to properly engage in novel driving scenarios, both with and without the haptics, based upon their training. Participants will be scored on various metrics, such as lane holding, stopping distance, ability to avoid collisions, etc.

### 4.4.4 Data Acquisition:
This piece of software will allow us to harvest data from training and test scenarios so that it can be analyzed for research and used to guide further training. Saved data will remain associated with the user to judge areas of improvement.

## 4.4 Project Schedule
The project schedule provides specific information about the project timeline.

Included is a development schedule in the form of a Gantt Chart, and a table outlining task and resource allocations.

The first part of the project to be implemented in the fall will be the Data Acquisition (telemetry) system. Independent of any other subsystems, the ability to objectively evaluate the user is paramount to the research and therapy program.

The next part of the project to be implemented will be the Test and Training Scenarios. As the respective structure and functionality is relatively closely related, it’s sensible to develop them in parallel on an ongoing basis during the winter and spring.

The next part of the project to be implemented during the winter and spring will be the Experiment Scheduler. This component is the user application that will bring all of the other pieces together by managing their execution and data.
