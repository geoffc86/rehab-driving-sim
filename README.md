# Rehab Driving Simulator

The goal of this project is to develop a driving simulator, capable of providing haptic feedback, that can help rehabilitate drivers who have been physically challenged. We will be using a driving simulator provided by Prof. Smithâ€™s mechanical engineering team, possessing all the necessary controls and equipment. That includes a seat, throttle and brake controls, steering controls, and the pneumatic system. We want to develop the most accurate software possible so that our end product is a usable research tool. This life-like feedback is what differentiates our project from similar rehabilitative simulators. Other research does exist in this domain, but none of their machines provide physical feedback. That means the their data excludes the haptic and vestibular variables of driving. Our simulator will likely be the first of its kind, providing a genuine driving experience for those recovering from physical ailments.
