# 6.0 Software Design Description Document

## 6.1 Introduction
This document presents the architectural design for the Rehabilitation Driving Simulator project, a software suite which aims to help individuals re-learn how to drive after a traumatic brain injury by allowing users to experience a simulation of real-world driving.

### 6.1.1 System Objective
The goal of the project is to provide a user-friendly and realistic experience for people using the simulator; as a model of real-world driving, the simulator uses hardware and software in tight correspondence. The software will feature different courses to navigate to in order to train and test the user in different driving scenarios. The motion simulation software will create haptic feedback that it will send to the hardware in order to provide users a realistic sensation of driving a car.

### 6.1.2 Hardware, Software, and Human Interfaces

#### 6.1.2.1 Hardware Interfaces:
##### 6.1.2.1.1 Network:
The base system, a Windows 10 PC, is connected to the internet via a wired LAN connection.
##### 6.1.2.1.2 Audio/Visual:
Three HD video monitors and two speakers are connected to the system via HDMI connections.
##### 6.1.2.1.3 Motion Simulation:
Two single degree-of-freedom screw motors and a “rumble” device in the seat are connected to the system.

#### 6.1.2.2 Software Interfaces:
The system interacts with the motion simulation hardware through purpose-built motion simulation software (Sim Commander and SimTools).
The top-level user software is primarily based upon commercial games that run via the Steam distribution and digital rights management platform.
The core of our team’s software - telemetry, content, and scheduler - interacts with the aforementioned motion simulation and top-level user software via their respective APIs and command-line arguments.

#### 6.1.2.3 Human Interfaces:
Human users interact with the system in 2 primary ways:
##### 6.1.2.3.1 Logitech wireless keyboard and touchpad connected by USB unifying receiver.
##### 6.1.2.3.2 XBox-branded, Logitech-manufactured steering wheel game controller connected by USB cable.
##### 6.1.2.3.3 Custom-built gas, brake, and clutch pedals connected by USB cable.

## 6.2 CSCI Description
### 6.2.1 Concept of Execution
System execution will begin with the experiment scheduler application, which will call the top-level user software with the appropriate parameters for test or training scenarios. The telemetry/data gathering functionality is enabled by default.

Regardless of whether the session constitutes a test or a training scenario, the user will be instructed to perform a sequence of driving maneuvers using the steering wheel and pedals as they would in a real car. Users will be expected to safely navigate a series of roads, adhering to realistic speed limits, stopping at stop signs, and negotiating traffic. Physics, logic, and graphics processing will be handled by the top-level user software, and data about user performance will accessed by the telemetry functionality through the top-level user software’s API.

The telemetry functionality will record information about the user’s performance to a file for analysis and feedback. For training scenarios, the data gathered will be evaluated and used to provide feedback on what the user should concentrate on improving. For testing scenarios, the data gathered will be used as a yardstick for the user’s ongoing progress.

### 6.2.2 Interface Design
The following sections provide visual diagrams detailing the how to the software will interface with the hardware.

#### 6.2.2.1 Interface Identification and Diagram

#### 6.2.2.2 Project Interactions:
The users will create individual accounts, or user profiles, within the experiment scheduler. These profiles will log their individual progress on an ongoing basis. The experiment scheduler will direct the functionality of the top-level user software by passing it command line parameters.

The maps the users will practice on will be generated from the top-level software itself. The top-level software has functionality that provides the user with feedback both in real time and after the trial. Real-time information is shown to users as they drive via functions included on the dashboard/HUD. A results screen with relevant data from the trial is displayed after the trial experiment.

Data from the user’s trial will be recorded by the telemetry/data gathering software interacting with the top-level software via its API. This data will be made available to the scheduler, which will log it in the user’s profile.


## 6.3 Preliminary User Manual
The user will be buckled into the simulator’s seat with no direct control over software functionality. The software will be started and controlled by the test administrator.

Training sessions and tests will be initiated from the Experiment Scheduler we build, implementing the supplied parameters. The user is required to supply throttle, brake, and steering inputs as required by the parameters of the particular session.

Details on Scheduler usage TBD—test administrator will have scenarios to choose from and parameters to set.
