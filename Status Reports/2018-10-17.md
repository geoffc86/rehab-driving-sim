##What Was Completed Last Week

###Documentation
*Software Development Plan (complete)

###Design
*Familiarization with simulator software and runtime environment
*Research on potential modifications to/extensions of motion control and top-level user software (games)

###Development
*None

###Administrative
*Met with Prof. Smith regarding next steps on architectural design
*Acquired OneCard access to Mechanical Engineering lab containing simulator hardware

##What Will Be Completed This Week

###Documentation
*None

###Design
*Pin down suite of user software
*Broadly, determine nature of modifications necessary to implement requirements
*Start work on architectural design

###Development
*Set up full development stack on simulator hardware
*Set up remote development environment(s)
    *Acquire (additional, as applicable) licenses for relevant software
    *Follow-through on Prof. Forney's offer of additional hardware resources in ACT lab

###Administrative
*Meet with Prof. Smith regarding conclusions drawn from research and preliminary design work

##Any Issues
*Ongoing difficulty with modifying compiled commercial products without access to codebase or API
    *While C "decompilers" exist, the nature of the end products would tend to render this impractical

##Any Help Needed
*Related to the above point, experienced guidance would be appreciated.
