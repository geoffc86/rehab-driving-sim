## What Will Be Completed This Week

### Documentation
* Architectural Design Document

### Design
* Determine nature of, specific modifications necessary to implement requirements
* Familiarization with top-level user software dev console, re: parameters
* Start work on architectural design

### Development
* Implement prototype of telemetry system
* Set up remote development environment(s)
    * Acquire (additional, as applicable) licenses for relevant software
    * Follow-through on Prof. Forney's offer of additional hardware resources in ACT lab

### Administrative
* Meet with Prof. Smith regarding design work

## Any Issues
* Ongoing difficulty with modifying compiled commercial products without access to codebase or API
    * While C "decompilers" exist, the nature of the end products would tend to render this approach impractical
* Difficulty in achieving necessary functional modifications via these means

## Any Help Needed
* Related to the above point, experienced guidance would be appreciated.
