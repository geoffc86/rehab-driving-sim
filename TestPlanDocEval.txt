This is a nice job, and you have captured several important items about
your project, such as the fact that there isn't much unit or integration
testing you can do because of the API restrictions.

It's good that you have still listed testing at all levels, and noted
that it will be by "inspection" [in the parlance of our times].  It
would be good to have some sort of matrix that lists the tests and links
them to the requirements, but I think you have covered it well enough.

I notice that you used the outline from CMSI 401, even though this is not
that class.  The outline for CMSI 402 is different and includes more of
the details that I'm referring to above.

It's difficult to write tests for third party software, but you can still
outline in more detail what you'll be looking for in the "inspection" of
the output.  For example, what items will you be looking at in the report
from the experiment and what values do you expect to see?  What are the
pass/fail criteria for the tests?

Take a look at the CMSI 402 outline and descriptions to see what I mean.
Then give this one more shot by the end of the semester for full credit
on the assignment.

Nice work!

So far for the semester:
Proposal:      5.0  out of  5.0  points
Requirements: 15.0  out of 15.0  points
Test Plan:    12.0  out of 15.0  points
Homework 1:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Homework 2:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Particip.:     1.5  out of  1.5  points
              40.18 out of 43.18 points = 93.05% which is an A

Keep it up!
